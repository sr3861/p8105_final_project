		        		<h2>Project Description:</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Summary:</strong> This survey provides nationally representative data on inmates
held in state prisons and federally-owned and operated prisons.
Through personal interviews conducted from October 2003 through May
2004, inmates in both state and federal prisons provided information
about their current offense and sentence, criminal history, family
background and personal characteristics, prior drug and alcohol use
and treatment programs, gun possession and use, and prison activities,
programs, and services. Prior surveys of State prison inmates were
conducted in 1974, 1979, 1986, 1991, and 1997. Sentenced federal
prison inmates were interviewed in the 1991 and 1997 surveys.</span></p>
