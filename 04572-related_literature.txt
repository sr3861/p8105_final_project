Presents counts and rates of veterans in state and federal prison and local
jail in 2011 and 2012. This report describes incarcerated veterans by
demographic characteristics, military characteristics, and disability and
mental health status. It describes current offense, sentencing, and
criminal history characteristics by veteran status. It also examines combat
experience associated with lifetime mental health disorders among
incarcerated veterans. Findings are based on data from the National Inmate
Survey, conducted between February 2011 and May 2012. Data from previous
BJS surveys of inmates in prison and jail are used to establish historical
trends regarding incarcerated veterans.

Fifty-eight percent of State prisoners and 63 percent of sentenced jail
inmates met the criteria for drug dependence or abuse during 2007-09, as
defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,
Fourth Edition (DSM-IV). In comparison, approximately 5 percent of the
total general population age 18 or older met the DSM-IV criteria for drug
dependence or abuse during this period. Overall, both State inmates (63
percent) and jail inmates (64 percent) regularly used marijuana/hashish
more than any other drugs prior to incarceration. This was followed by
cocaine/crack (24 percent of State inmates and 38 percent of jail inmates).
Fewer State inmates (42 percent) and Jail inmates (37 percent) reported
using drugs at the time of their offense. Sixty-nine percent of female
State inmates and 72 percent of jail inmates met the DSM-IV criteria for
drug dependence or abuse, compared to 57 percent of males in State prison
and 62 percent of jail inmates. Drug dependence for State inmates and jail
inmates is also reported by inmate age and race/ethnicity (Hispanics and
non-Hispanic White or Black inmates). Twenty-eight percent of State inmates
and 22 percent of sentenced jail inmates who met the criteria for drug
dependence or abuse participated in a drug treatment program since
admission to their current facility. 1 table

This Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) report presents detailed
statistical tables on mortality in state and federal prisons. It provides
information on cause of death; decedent characteristics, such as age,
gender, and race or ethnicity; and mortality rates of inmate populations,
compared to the general U.S. adult population. The report is based on BJS’s
annual Mortality in Correctional Institutions data collection, which
obtains information on persons who died while in the physical custody of
state departments of corrections.

Presents estimates of the prevalence of mental health problems among prison
and jail inmates using self-reported data on recent history and symptoms of
mental disorders. The report compares the characteristics of offenders with
a mental health problem to those without, including current offense,
criminal record, sentence length, time expected to be served, co-occurring
substance dependence or abuse, family background, and facility conduct
since current admission. It presents measures of mental health problems by
gender, race, Hispanic origin, and age. The report describes mental health
problems and mental health treatment among inmates since admission to jail
or prison. Findings are based on the Survey of Inmates in State and Federal
Correctional Facilities, 2004, and the Survey of Inmates in Local Jails,
2002.

Presents the prevalence of medical problems among state and federal
prisoners and jail inmates, highlighting differences in rates of chronic
conditions and infectious diseases by demographic characteristic. The
report describes health care services and treatment received by prisoners
and jail inmates with health problems, including doctor 's visits, use of
prescription medication, and other types of treatment. It also explains
reasons why inmates with health problems were not receiving care and
describes inmate satisfaction with health services received while
incarcerated. Data were from the 2011-12 National Inmate Survey.

This paper examines the effectiveness of drug courts to reduce the size of
the incarcerated drug-offending population using data from the Survey of
Inmates in State Correctional Facilities and the Survey of Inmates in Local
Jails. We find that very few of those entering state prison in 2004 or jail
in 2002 would have been eligible for drug diversion through state drug
courts. The policy implication is that drug courts and other diversion
programs require substantial redesign if they are to contribute to a
reduction in the incarcerated population.

This annual report compares changes in the prison population during 2008 to
changes from yearend 2000 through yearend 2007. These are the only
comprehensive national-level data on prison admissions and releases.
Findings cover data on decreasing growth in State and Federal prisons
through declining admissions and increasing releases; imprisonment rates
for prisoners sentenced to more than 1 year by jurisdiction; the number of
males and females in prison; age, race, and gender distributions; the
number of inmates in custody in State and Federal prison and local jails;
and custody incarceration rates. The report also includes the count for
inmates held within facilities operated by and for the military, U.S.
territories, Indian country, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and
juvenile authorities. Highlights include the following: the U.S. prison
population grew at the slowest rate (0.8 percent) since 2000, reaching
1,610,446 sentenced prisoners at yearend 2008; growth of the prison
population since 2000 (1.8 percent per year on average) was less than a
third of the average annual rate during the 1990s (6.5 percent per year on
average); between 2000 and 2008 the number of blacks in prison declined by
18,400, lowering the imprisonment rate to 3,161 men and 149 women per
100,000 persons in the U.S. resident black population.
