Data Science: Final Project Proposal

### Group Members:

Mackenzie Frost (maf2311), Allison Randy-Cofie (amr2371), Shritama Ray
(sr3861), Anna Zavodszky (amz2148)

### Tentative Project Title:

Health of Incarcerated Individuals in State & Federal Correctional
Facilities, 2003-2004

### Motivation for this Project:

Some of our group members are interested in HIV and mental health, so we
chose to center our project on these outcomes. Additionally, we felt
that focusing on incarcerated individuals would present an interesting
lens through which to study these diseases due to this populationâ€™s
elevated risk for HIV and mental health conditions and their often
overlooked, disenfranchised status.

### Intended Final Products:

We will create a website with the following pages: 1.) Overview page
with high-level summary of our project scope, screencast, and
information about our group members and data. 2.) Exploratory data
analysis page with descriptive statistics, methods used, tables, and
graphs. 3.) Explanatory data analysis page with tables, graphs (likely
in dashboard form), statistical analyses, and methods used in examining
the associations between variables and whether causality can be
inferred. 4.) Page with our full written report. The website will link
to our data source and Github repository. The repository will include
our data (if the data source permits its public distribution);
associated codebooks, terms of use, etc.; project proposal; and code for
our website and data analyses.

### Anticipated Data Sources:

United States. Bureau of Justice Statistics. Survey of Inmates in State
and Federal Correctional Facilities, \[United States\], 2004.
Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research
\[distributor\], 2019-12-12. <https://doi.org/10.3886/ICPSR04572.v6>

### Planned Analyses / Visualizations / Coding Challenges:

We plan to conduct exploratory data analyses examining demographic
variables (e.g., age, race/ethnicity), health status (e.g., HIV, mental
health), and incarceration-related factors among our population overall.
We will conduct regression analyses to determine what variables are
associated with health status and whether HIV and mental health are
related in subpopulations. We will create visualizations including a
barchart of race/ethnicity distribution, density plot or histogram of
age distribution, and scatterplots and tables to visualize the
explanatory analyses described above. Regarding expected coding
challenges, we expect it will be difficult to organize/clean and pare
down the very large initial dataset. With over 3000 variables, we must
have an analysis plan in place to identify needed variables, what to do
with various data inconsistencies/errors, etc.

### Planned Timeline:

Proposal: 11/12  
Review meeting: 11/15-18  
Finalize the planned analyses/variables of interest: 11/18  
Import, tidy, and pare down dataset: 11/25  
Analyses and all website pages: 12/2  
Screencast, report, and final touches on website: 12/9  
Peer assessment: 12/10
